# A dictionary is like a list, but with text instead of numeric indicies

mylist = [3, 4, 7]  # create a list with square brakets

# Dictionaries have key:value pairs
# You can get all of the keys or values with the appropriate method

print(mydict.keys())

# You can add values to a dictionary by assigning new key:value pairs

# You can also delete key:value pairs from a dictionary with 'del'

del mydict['newkey']

# Now here's a thought question for you
# Where should the aa2kd dictionary be defined?
#    1. outside the function and used globally (as it is here)
#    2. inside the function
#    3. outside the function and passed in as an argument
# There is no single correct answer for this: it depends on the situation

# Sometimes you want to sort a dictionary by keys
# This is done easily with the sorted() function
