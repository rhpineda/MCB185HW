# What if your program expects a probability distribution and the
# values don't add up to 1.0?

# One way to handle this is for your program to exit

# But what about rounding errors?
# You should never ask for floating point numbers to be equal to a value
# Instead, make sure the numbers are close enough

# To check if something works, use "try"
# If the trial fails, the "except" clause is executed
# Note: errors and warnings are generally sent to stderr
